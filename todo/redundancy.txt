- NOTES:
    -   if during the following steps you run into step syntax collisions (duplicate steps)
        this indicates that the other step might be replaced by our more generic version.
    -   try to do changes step by step and test progress regularely
- Instructions:
    - count the number of total existing step definitions
    - create a step @step('I fill the {field} field with {text}'), replacing:

        tests/steps/iteration_field_steps.py:@step("I fill the iteration field with {text}")
        tests/steps/iteration_field_steps.py:@when("I update the iteration field to {text}")
        tests/steps/iteration_field_steps.py:@when("I fill in the iteration field with {text}")

    - remove completely (and is usage)

        tests/steps/iteration_field_steps.py:@then("I should see an iteration field")

    - check for concrete iteration expected using existing steps
        tests/steps/iteration_field_steps.py:@then("I should see the iteration information displayed")
        tests/steps/iteration_field_steps.py:@then("it should show {iteration}")
        tests/steps/iteration_field_steps.py:@then("the artifact should be updated with new iteration {iteration}")
        tests/steps/iteration_field_steps.py:@then("I see the iteration is set to {iteration}")
        tests/steps/iteration_field_steps.py:@then("the artifact should be saved with iteration {iteration}")
    - make sure all smoke tests pass by running `run_radish.py local tests/features/ --tags=smoke --trace`
    - count the number of total existing step definitions
