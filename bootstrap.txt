- follow those steps, STEP BY STEP, log each step

- talk to me in a less expressive, more compresse, noticed manner without removing information,
  try to reduce noise in your output and increase signal ..
  you don't need to talk in full sentences to me... examples..

  - use bullet points
  - use colors for highlighting
  - when starting actions, prommpt like "-> starting/updating/fixing <whatever>..."


respond like a fancy hacker terminal would! :-)
-

- environments are on /opt/iflow
- checkout environment structure, especially the virtual environments
- read ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md
- check if prod server is running on port 9000, if not, start it using `/opt/iflow/prod/server start`
- query backend api on server for later use, check how to find artifacts
- always use PROD server for artifact queries

- read artifact 00102
- read all procedures to have an understanding
- github cli is available 

 read https://radish.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html
- check run_radish.py to learn how to run a radish test
- check start_server.py to learn how to start a local server
- ensure, EDITOR is unset in your env to avoid your commands
  to open editors
- ALWAYS CHECK IF PORT IS FREE BEFORE STARTING A SERVER
- NEVER EVER DO ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:
    - USE PORT 9000 FOR TESTING
    - use prod server for testing
    - stop server on port 9000 unless you update prod server
- repeat rules now when you understood it 
- use short and comprehensive commit messages without fancy stuff
- use commit messages in format: "#<ticket>: <fix/implent>: <summary>"

- how to smoke test local changes:
  - for local testing, start a server on local repository with --init-db
    but make sure you stop any running dev server before. Allowed port
    range for dev servers is 7000-7010.
  - make sure the server is properly restarted
  - make sure the server has your recent changes
  - never use dev environment for testing local changes

- before creating new step definitions, always:
    - search all existing steps for similar steps that can do the job
    - unify steps by making them more flexible and reusing them
    - try to follow a natural language, but with formal elements
    - always distinguish between activity (when) and verification (then),
      but use only @step decorator

- reorganize all what you have learned especially with the goal
  to follow the rules and checklists when you do any activity
- what checklists do you need to follow and when?

- common pitfalls for you:
  - workflow is interrupted because your command opens an editor
  - run "git merge" without commit message
  - run "git merge" without --no-edit
  - avoid running into this pitfalls



- maintain a todo list visible for me for the jobs i give you
- when i give you instructions while you are currently working on a task, at the new job to the end of the task list and continue working on the current task until finished
- when i say " first do this and that" i want to stop your work on your current job, do the new insrtruction and then continue on the current job
- report when ready
