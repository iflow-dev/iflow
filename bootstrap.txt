- follow those steps, STEP BY STEP, log each step
- check run_server.py to learn how to run a radish test
- 
- ALWAYS CHECK IF PORT IS FREE BEFORE STARTING A SERVER
- NEVER USE PORT 9000 FOR TESTING

- environments are on /opt/iflow
- checkout environment structure, especially the virtual environments
- read ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md
- check if prod server is running on port 9000, if not, start it using `/opt/iflow/prod/server start`
- query backend api on server for later use, check how to find artifacts
- always use PROD server for artifact queries

- read artifact 00102
- read all procedures to have an understanding
- github cli is available

- for local testing, start a server on local repository with --init-db
  but make sure you stop any running dev server before. Allowed port
  range for dev servers is 7000-7010.

- before creating new step definitions, always:
    - search all existing steps for similar steps that can do the job
    - unify steps by making them more flexible and reusing them
    - try to follow a natural language, but with formal elements
    - always distinguish between activity (when) and verification (then),
      but use only @step decorator
