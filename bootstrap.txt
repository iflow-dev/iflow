- follow those steps, STEP BY STEP, log each step
- check run_radish.py to learn how to run a radish test
- check start_server.py to learn how to start a local server
- ensure, EDITOR is unset in your env to avoid your commands
  to open editors
- ALWAYS CHECK IF PORT IS FREE BEFORE STARTING A SERVER
- NEVER EVER DO ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:
    - USE PORT 9000 FOR TESTING
    - use prod server for testing
    - stop server on port 9000 unless you update prod server
- repeat rules now when you understood it 
- use short and comprehensive commit messages without fancy stuff
- use commit messages in format: "#<ticket>: <fix/implent>: <summary>"

- environments are on /opt/iflow
- checkout environment structure, especially the virtual environments
- read ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md
- check if prod server is running on port 9000, if not, start it using `/opt/iflow/prod/server start`
- query backend api on server for later use, check how to find artifacts
- always use PROD server for artifact queries

- read artifact 00102
- read all procedures to have an understanding
- github cli is available 

- how to smoke test local changes:
  - for local testing, start a server on local repository with --init-db
    but make sure you stop any running dev server before. Allowed port
    range for dev servers is 7000-7010.
  - make sure the server is properly restarted
  - make sure the server has your recent changes
  - never use dev environment for testing local changes

- before creating new step definitions, always:
    - search all existing steps for similar steps that can do the job
    - unify steps by making them more flexible and reusing them
    - try to follow a natural language, but with formal elements
    - always distinguish between activity (when) and verification (then),
      but use only @step decorator
