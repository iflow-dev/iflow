The project verification is done due to a high degree of automation. Part of that automation are
those kind of tests:

<testtype:BDD>
: BDD based tests on the frontend. See [bdd.md] for details.

<testtype:unit>
: Unit tests of controls and html via node-js based test automation framework. See [unit.md] for details.
